Cmod A7-35T digital clock Demo
Description
This project is a Vivado demo using the Cmod A7's LEDs, pushbuttons, and USB UART bridge, written in VHDL. When programmed onto the board, the pushbuttons adjust the digital clock.

To use the USB-UART bridge feature of this demo, the Cmod A7-35T must be connected to a serial terminal on the computer it is connected to over the MicroUSB cable. For more information on how to set up and use a serial terminal, such as Tera Term or PuTTY, refer to this tutorial. 
Connect a terminal program with the settings 9600 baud rate, 8 bits, one stop bit, and no parity bit. update the clock by writing hour minute second with the keyboard and the enter key to validate the time.
